# SPTG-LCC: Single-shot, Pixel-level, Target-free and General LiDAR-Camera Extrinsic Self-Calibration
The data fusion of LiDAR and camera holds vast application prospects, with calibration as a crucial prerequisite. In this paper, we propose SPTG-LCC, a novel, general, and target-free LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration framework. On the one hand, SPTG-LCC  is open-source, which is very suitable for practitioners seeking a robust, general, and convenient target-free calibration tool. On the other hand, the four diverse datasets are open-source, which is very suitable for researchers to comprehensively evaluate feature-based target-free LiDAR-camera calibration methods.

# To-Do List

## 当前任务

- [ ] **Datasets open-source**
our  self-assembled  sensor suites as follows, where the camera is the Realsense D455  and ZED 2i. Four diverse datasets were collected using these four suites,  named **FB-LCC-NS360**, **FB-LCC-NS70**,  **FB-LCC-RS16**, and **FB-LCC-MEMS-M1**,  which are released for evaluating feature-based LiDAR-camera calibration methods. Moreover, sequence 00 on the public KITTI odometry benchmark  is evenly divided into 67 LiDAR-camera data pairs as a dataset, named **FB-LCC-RS-KITTI-VLP-64**.
