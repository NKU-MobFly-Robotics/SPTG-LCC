# SPTG-LCC: Single-shot, Pixel-level, Target-free and General LiDAR-Camera Extrinsic Self-Calibration
The data fusion of LiDAR and camera holds vast application prospects, with calibration as a crucial prerequisite. In this paper, we propose SPTG-LCC, a novel, general, and target-free LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration framework. On the one hand, SPTG-LCC  is open-source, which is very suitable for practitioners seeking a robust, general, and convenient target-free calibration tool. On the other hand, the four diverse datasets are open-source, which is very suitable for researchers to comprehensively evaluate feature-based target-free LiDAR-camera calibration methods.
